         "title": "Threat 01: Habitat Loss",
         "description": "Habitat loss is a serious threat to leopards in Sri Lanka. The rapid expansion of human settlements, agriculture and infrastructure development has led to the destruction and fragmentation of the leopard's habitat. This in turn destroys their natural behaviour and reduces the availability of prey.",
         "description_2":"Consequences: The impact of habitat loss includes increased conflicts between humans and leopards, reduced prey bases, and limited space for leopards to roam freely.This situation may result in a decline in leopard populations and genetic diversity.  Mitigation efforts: Sri Lankan conservation organizations, such as The Wildlife Conservation Society(WCS) in SriLanka actively works to address the issue of habitat loss for leopards. Recognizing the critical role that suitable habitats play in the survival of leopard populations, WCS implements conservation programs aimed at preserving and restoring their natural environments.Through research, habitat monitoring, and community engagement, WCS endeavors to mitigate the impact of human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion on leopard habitats. By promoting sustainable land-use practices, advocating for protected areas, and collaborating with local communities, WCS contributes to the conservation of leopard habitats, ensuring these elusive big cats have the necessary space and resources for their survival"

         "description_2":"Consequences: The effects of illegal wildlife trade include decline in leopards, loss of biodiversity, and disruption of ecosystems. In addition, this perpetuates an insupportable cycle that threatens the long-term survival of Sri Lankan leopards. Mitigation Efforts: Organisations such as The Wilderness & Wildlife Conservation Trust(WWCT) in SriLanka plays a crucial role in safeguarding leopards from the threats posed by illegal wildlife trade. Through its dedicated efforts, WWCT engages in rigorous research, monitoring, and conservation initiatives aimed at protecting leopard populations and their habitats.  The organization collaborates with local communities, government agencies, and international partners to raise awareness about the detrimental impacts of the illegal wildlife trade on leopards, By conducting educational programs, implementing anti-poaching measures, and advocating for stronger wildlife protection policies, WWCT actively contributes to the fight against the illicit trafficking of leopards and their bodyparts."
